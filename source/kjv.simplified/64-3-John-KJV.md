# 3 John

<sup>**1**</sup>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

<sup>**2**</sup>Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.

<sup>**3**</sup>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.

<sup>**4**</sup>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

<sup>**5**</sup>Beloved, you do faithfully whatsoever you do to the brethren, and to strangers;

<sup>**6**</sup>Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:

<sup>**7**</sup>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

<sup>**8**</sup>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.

<sup>**9**</sup>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.

<sup>**10**</sup>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.

<sup>**11**</sup>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.

<sup>**12**</sup>Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and you know that our record is true.

<sup>**13**</sup>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:

<sup>**14**</sup>But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.

<sup>**1**</sup>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

<sup>**2**</sup>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in your house:

<sup>**3**</sup>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>**4**</sup>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,

<sup>**5**</sup>Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;

<sup>**6**</sup>That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

<sup>**7**</sup>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.

<sup>**8**</sup>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,

<sup>**9**</sup>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

<sup>**10**</sup>I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:

<sup>**11**</sup>Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:

<sup>**12**</sup>Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:

<sup>**13**</sup>Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

<sup>**14**</sup>But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

<sup>**15**</sup>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;

<sup>**16**</sup>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

<sup>**17**</sup>If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

<sup>**18**</sup>If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on mine account;

<sup>**19**</sup>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owest unto me even yours own self besides.

<sup>**20**</sup>Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.

<sup>**21**</sup>Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.

<sup>**22**</sup>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.

<sup>**23**</sup>There salute you Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

<sup>**24**</sup>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

<sup>**25**</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
